# social-network-api

## Description 
The idea for this application is to have a social network app that you could see users interface with thoughts. Then there is reactions to those thoughts and you could be friends with users. It is a social network application for those who may not want to be a part of other social networks. It gives you an opportunity to see the thoughts of others and perhaps identify with the users. In development of the application I have begun with users and thoughts from the cast of Big Bang Theory. The difficult part so far has been learning the proper code to delete thoughts. All in all this was great to gain valuable experience with mongoose.

## Installation 
If you want to use the social network app you must have the node package modules installed for mongoose db compass to create your social network database. I have already seeded the data so you can test your routes in insomnia. There will be a link to a walk through video to show the functionality of the application. 

## Usage 
Watch this walkthrough video to demonstrate how to use the application.
